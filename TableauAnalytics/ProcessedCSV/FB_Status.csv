Military leaders, decorated veterans, and members of Congress from both parties have rightly come together to condemn what is - by the administration's own admission - a cheap, cynical ploy to rally the darkest corners of Trump's base against yet another invented domestic enemy.
 
There is NO basis to Trump's claim that the service of Patriotic transgender people impacts our military readiness.  On the contrary, the President today has weakened our military and by doing so, diminished both our security and our standing in the world community.

Of course, we know that America's security (and America's global leadership) is not what this President cares about, nor has it ever been.  And so it is left to us, the PEOPLE of this country to care even more... to fill the void that he leaves every single day.

So please, today, tomorrow, and every day going forward - stand with your brothers and sisters of every race, religion, and gender that is a target of this administration's cruelty.   Support those organizations that are on the front lines against Trump's hate agenda.  Reach out to those in your community who everyday wake up fearing the worst.... and make sure they know that there is no tweet, no executive order, no act of  sanctioned aggression that will make you turn your back.

We live in an increasingly polarized country.  Between cable news, social media, and even the places we choose to live and work, it’s easier than ever to retreat into our ideological bubbles, attacking those who don't toe our ideological line.  Progressives do it.  Conservatives do it.  There are times I know I am guilty of this as well. 

But when I watch this video, I see something that crosses into an even more dangerous place: a piece of propaganda the goal of which is to teach the viewer that our fellow Americans are to be feared… and even worse. How does this video advance debate?  How does it bring people together for common ideals?  How does it do anything but cast Americans as “enemies” to be defeated in a cynical ploy to sell as many weapons as possible?
 
My history with the NRA is no secret.  I don’t hold them in high regard and I know they certainly aren't fans of mine.  And that’s fine – we don’t need to work from the same values, and we probably never will. 

But today, I am asking the National Rifle Association of America - pleading with you in fact: Please, please, please remove this video.  There is no amount of gun sales that can offset the potential damage you may do with this.  Come after politicians.  Come after policy makers.  Come after ME.

Thank you, Jimmy Kimmel for being so honest and vulnerable in sharing this story and reminding us all of something that should never be ignored, taken lightly, pushed aside or forgotten: your ability to receive proper healthcare should never be based on how much money you make. 

“We were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago, millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all. Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition. You were born with a pre-existing condition. And if your parents didn’t have medical insurance, you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition.

If your baby is going to die, and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make. I think that’s something that, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?”

The wage gap is real, and it's persistent. Women still make just 80 cents for every dollar paid to a man – and the wage gap is even wider for many women of color. African American women are paid 63 cents for every dollar white men make, and Latinas, just 54 cents.

These numbers tell a sinister story: that as long as we accept unequal pay, we don't see women as whole people. I am not 80% of a person. Neither are you, or the women in your lives. But every day the wage gap persists, that's what we tell women. California is home to 12% of the country's women - more than any other state. How we treat women in California sends an important message across the country, and women in many industries still face discriminatory pay practices, are subject to unfair scheduling practices at their jobs, and are less able to build up assets to create a safety net for themselves and their families.

This day 13 years ago, San Francisco made a move that was a first for our nation. It was a rebellious gesture at the time, gay marriage was illegal almost everywhere including the state of California, but one that was needed to keep our country moving forward.
 
During the month that marriage licenses were issued, we witnessed couples traveling from all over the United States and from other countries to be married. We were able to witness joy, excitement, longing, love and hope amongst so many couples that had waited far too long to experience one of the biggest days of their lives.
 
But February 12th, 2004 isn’t what lead us to where we are today. It was the millions of conversations that were held and won on this topic that changed it. It was the debates amongst colleagues and family members, different generations engaging with one another. These conversations are what changed our nation. It’s been an unbelievable journey to get to where we are today. But as we recognize this anniversary, we must also recognize the fight ahead of us. 

With a President that seems determined to lead our nation backward, it is more important now than ever that we stand together to defend equality. We must continue to fight back against the hateful rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration -- but we cannot do it alone. 

It will take each one of us, engaging with our friends, our neighbors, and our colleagues. Creating environments where everyone feels protected, connected, and respected. Calling our legislators. Writing letters to our leaders. Marching together. Protesting peacefully. By standing together, we will build a moral wall to defend the values and principles that make our nation so great.

Stripping federal funds from UC would only create more innocent victims and more Trump carnage.

10128918116_10155096549773117,"A quick breakdown of the facts: 

- A refugee is defined as “someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence.”

-  51% of refugees are children. 1% of all refugees will ever be resettled. 

- 1 in every 113 people in the world is a refugee.

- In 2016 California accepted 7,909 refugees, the most of any other state. 

- Immigrants in general, and refugees in particular, are among the least statistically likely people in American society to commit crimes of any kind.

- The vetting process for each individual refugee involves: 8 government agencies, 6 security databases, 5 separate background checks, 4 biometric security checks, 3 in-person interviews, 2 interagency security checks running data against criminal, intelligence, and terrorism databases

- Though the Executive Order only lasts 120 days, during that time clearances expire. Many refugees have waited years to get a chance to come to the United States. Those that are stopped from boarding their planes during this time may have to restart the process and wait years again. For many of those, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity which now may expire.

- The Executive Order does address religion specifically. It includes a provision stating Christian refugees and other religious minorities will be prioritized. Trump specifically noted this provision while discussing the ban.

We have witnessed a nation divided and wounded. People feel frustrated and misunderstood, fearful and left behind, and in many cases - heartbroken by our country’s choices.  

We have seen horrific examples of racism, misogyny, and hatred. Too many Americans are forced to wonder if they are still safe, still wanted, still valued, and still accepted in our country.

Let me be clear about what we are doing and will do here in California: we will be active and participatory, moving our state forward, while staying vigilant and standing strong for our values and against any attempts to move us backwards.

In California, we believe in inclusion. 

We are a cause and a mission. We represent progress and don't back down. Now more than ever, I am proud of this state, where we have crafted the future first, year after year. We must have a sense of resolve and purpose, because the nation needs us. 

With increased reports of abusive and hateful incidents in the past week, too many kids are living in fear. So I want to repeat what I said to all children at the convention this summer: 

To our children, I want you to know that when you hear people say that you and your family don’t matter, because of who you are, what you look like, or who you love, I want you to know one thing -- The people in this state, and all across the country, believe that you matter. We believe that you belong here. We need you here. We believe that you can be whoever you are, and become whatever you want to be. And we’re going to fight for you.

10128918116_10154659628093117,"Bill Maher is an agitator, in the best sense of the word.

Bill pushes boundaries, not merely to shock, offend, and provoke (though he most certainly does shock, offend, and provoke), but to make us think, to stretch our brains, expand our horizons, and force anyone with intellectual honesty to ponder new perspectives. He doesn’t provoke us merely for the sake of provocation; he agitates because he understands that we have agency—the responsibility and the ability to create change.

He informs and he entertains. He makes us laugh, scream, cuss, spit out our drink, and sometimes throw things at the TV. Bill tackles complex issues, while never missing a chance to highlight the abundant absurdities of our current debates. And isn’t that the challenge these days? To find creative ways to get busy people to pay attention to important topics, in a world teeming with distractions, constantly tempting them to click elsewhere and chase the shiny object?

For decades, conventional wisdom held that any show touching on public affairs must choose between two wholly distinct and tightly circumscribed paths: either intelligent, informative, and substantive, OR funny, opinionated, and entertaining—and never the twain shall meet. Bill exposed this as a false choice, for he is all of the above and then some. 

The older I get, and the more time I spend in politics, the more I appreciate something Bill possesses in abundance: authenticity. He has a truly unique set of opinions and issues he cares about, proving that there’s no possibility that he’s following any semblance of a crowd. He’s not bowing to sponsors, or ratings, or anything other than what he believes. He’s been nominated for thirty-nine Emmys, penned five bestselling books, and still performs stand-up across the country. But you get the sense that he’d be doing exactly the same thing even if no one was watching, reading, or paying him.

Sometimes he gets angry, but anyone who doesn’t sometimes get angry these days just isn’t paying attention. Sometimes he’s called a cynic, but I’d argue that he’s anything but. In fact, I consider him an idealist, because it’s clear that he cares passionately about people and animals. The reason it’s so compelling to watch him inveigh against all things unjust, inaccurate, illogical, and hypocritical is because he actually gives a shit. He’s the real deal.

Bill has never been afraid to use his platform to speak his own brand of cold, hard truths, even at the risk of his own career. When his network show was cancelled, he didn’t come groveling, hat in hand, with a kinder, gentler milquetoast appeal to a broader audience. Instead, he found a venue which allowed him to take his smart, frank, and brave approach to TV even further.

His show is based on the radical idea that if you really believe in something you should be willing to engage in a thoughtful, intelligent, extended discussion—even an argument—about those beliefs. That’s why he doesn’t surround himself with like-minded sycophants; he’d rather be around sharp minds who challenge him. He’s more interested in debating an intelligent, articulate opponent than in knocking down an obtuse straw man.
I’m a politician, so you won’t be shocked by this bit of truth-telling: sometimes guests like to appear on shows that allow them to lazily pontificate, without fear of being challenged or questioned. Bill’s show ain’t that place.

As a frequent guest on Bill’s show, I can tell you it’s not easy to sit on that panel with him. It’s the sort of challenge that people in public service should submit to more often—no free passes, no canned talking points—just a real, honest—sometimes even a little vulgar—cage match of ideas. Guests can’t afford to be unprepared or inattentive, and Bill has zero tolerance for BS.

One of the keys to Bill’s success is that he listens, really listens to his guests. For a short time I hosted a public-affairs talk show of my own (a little-known fact, thanks to ratings that rivaled those of late-night C-Span reruns), where I learned just how hard it is to listen to a guest while trying to think of what to say next. Bill listens when others are speaking, a quality entirely too rare in today’s politics, and he’s more than willing to engage on a new piece of evidence, or follow a guest’s novel line of logic. His ability to deftly shift gears and explore fresh angles is what makes his show not just consistently compelling, but actually meaningful.

Like anyone who truly exemplifies the value of the First Amendment, and the need to protect it, Bill also pisses the hell out of a lot of people, including me. I disagree with him constantly, about all sorts of things, but, whether as a guest or a viewer, I never come away from his show without learning something new and appreciating the depth of the discussion.

Bill Maher is an envelope-pushing, hyper-intelligent, foul-mouthed, straight-talking, dope-smoking, hilarious, annoying, courageous, first-amendment hero. And he is eminently deserving of PEN Center USA’s esteemed First Amendment Award. Congrats!",,status,,2016-09-28 11:44:11,5745,295,417,4986,735,7,16,0,1,Gavin

10128918116_10154650795133117,"Woke up this morning to see that the shooter at Cascade Mall was obtained by the police. There are a lot of details we still don't know about the horrific shooting Friday night, when a man with a gun murdered five people in a mall outside of Seattle. But what we have learned is that 5 innocent people were shot to death, including a 16-year-old girl who had survived cancer, but not this trip to the mall. That's not the way the world should be.

In the time since this mass shooting, we have learned about yet another unthinkable shooting in Baltimore in which a toddler was shot, among seven other people, and across the U.S. other shootings and killings have occurred that won't even make the headlines.

There's nothing I can say now that hasn't been said before – shooting after shooting, death after death. Frankly, I'm sick and tired of having to say it: No one should have to live in fear that the next time they walk into a mall, a movie theater, a school or a church, they will be shot and killed by a person who should never have had a gun in the first place. 

Yet already, far too soon, the headlines are beginning to fade. I have heard people describe the horror that unfolded that night as having ended the lives of ""only five people."" They are discussing this mass shooting like it's some kind of a small event, unworthy of our attention or the news. Well, I am not having that.

The bottom line is this: If we don't take meaningful action to end gun violence, if we let the NRA and cowardly politicians dictate the rules, more people will die. More parents will have to bury their children because we didn't have the courage to stand up and do something. More lives will continue to be turned upside down, and the media and our country will continue to become numb to it all. We can't let any of this happen.

My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the victims and those who were in the mall – I cannot begin to imagine the horror. You've got my word that I will do everything I can to pass reforms to stop the next tragedy and save lives. #enough #cascademallshooting",,status,,2016-09-25 12:57:54,2805,278,264,2078,117,4,1,530,75,Gavin

10128918116_10154572850868117,"Donald Trump's speech last night was a disgrace to everything that California and our nation has accomplished with immigration reform. 

His trip to Mexico was nothing more than a hasty melodramatic photo op to attempt to win the hearts of Latinos across our nation. That failed attempt was followed by a speech condemning any form of amnesty and claiming that our current President hasn't done anything to fix it (he has actually deported more illegal immigrants than any other President). His speech laid out policies that will do nothing but bring our country backwards and produce more racism and fear.  

Immigration reform and amnesty is a bipartisan issue. President Reagan signed a law that gave amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. President George H.W. Bush referred to immigrants as our neighbors, noting that we needed to work together to solve the problem, not put up a fence. In fact, even Donald Trump's ""friend"" Rudy Giuliani was a champion of amnesty and, as Mayor of New York, supported policies that protected illegal immigrants.

My daughter Veronika used to surprise me with lunch at work so we could eat together. How many high school kids want to spend more time with their parents?
 
Since May 23, 2014, the day my 19-year-old daughter was shot and killed in the mass shooting in Isla Vista, there hasn’t been a day when I wouldn’t give anything to eat lunch with her again. To hear about her last math test, her next cross-country meet – to hear her laugh.
 
I know nothing I do now will change the fact that my daughter’s life was taken by a man who should never have had a gun on the day that he murdered six innocent people. Nothing will make my daughter show up outside my office door again. 
 
No parent should ever have to wonder what kind of amazing things their child would’ve done or how they would’ve grown up, if given the time. The headlines may disappear the next day, but the families and loved ones who are left behind to deal with the terrible loss don't forget. We cannot forget, and we cannot wait for another terrible reminder of what can happen when the wrong person has a gun.

Usually this is just a rhetorical device, a way of saying, “We need to focus our attention and marshal our forces to fix something we don’t like.” But this is no metaphor. By most of the ways we measure wars, climate change is the real deal: Carbon and methane are seizing physical territory, sowing havoc and panic, racking up casualties, and even destabilizing governments. (Over the past few years, record-setting droughts have helped undermine the brutal strongman of Syria and fuel the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria.) 

It’s not that global warming is like a world war. It is a world war. Its first victims, ironically, are those who have done the least to cause the crisis. But it’s a world war aimed at us all.

He’s running with an “R” next to his name, but what Donald Trump has done this election cycle -- the anger and bigotry he has fueled, the violence he’s incited -- is not a problem just for the Republicans to deal with.

What Trump is saying and doing is downright bad for our country, it’s bad for our reputation abroad, and it’s bad for our democracy. It makes me sick he’s gotten this far in the process.

This election isn’t about choosing between two people or even between two parties. This is about choosing a future where we tear down walls and barriers, not build new ones. It’s about rejecting race-baiting, fearmongering and cynical bigotry.

Here’s what I’m getting at: I don't want to win this election because the other guy is an unhinged, racist con man (which he is). I want to win because we stood together behind our ideas and defended our deepest values.

I refuse to watch my kids grow up in a world where self-serving, power-hungry frauds like Trump win. When we look back on this election 20 years from now, I want them to see that we refused to let such a candidate win -- that we stood up for what our country is truly about: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That all are created equal. That America is an engine of job creation and creativity, and that we’ve succeeded not just through innovation but through acceptance. Pro-worker. Pro-women.

Myth #1: Gun safety laws like Prop 63 won’t work because criminals won’t follow them.

THE FACTS: The reality is that smart gun laws save lives and do not rely on criminals’ compliance. Nationally, background checks have blocked nearly 2.5 million convicted felons, domestic abusers, and dangerously mentally ill people from illegally acquiring guns. Studies also show that states with stronger gun safety laws have much lower rates of gun violence. Over the last 2 decades, California has led the nation in strengthening its gun laws and, as a result, our state has cut its gun death rate by nearly 60%, twice as much as the other states. But we have more work to do. Prop 63 includes major reforms to proactively keep criminals from getting and using deadly weapons and to help law enforcement hold them accountable when they do.",,status,,2016-08-17 14:12:08,965,150,140,907,49,6,0,0,3,Gavin

3. He believes that harmful conversion therapy is effective.

4. He believes that parents should be able to force their children to go through conversion therapy. The American Psychological association said that efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks including depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.

5. Because he believes parents should be able to do this, he is  supporting the torture of LGBT youth.

6. He loves conversion therapy so much that he said that the federal government should re-direct money from LGBT organizations that provide critical HIV/AIDS services and give that money to organizations that provide conversion therapy.

We are lucky enough, as a nation, that over one million men and women are willing to put on their uniform and head to work every day knowing full well that they may not come home that night or that they may end up injured in the hospital. 

A vast majority of these brave men and women do their jobs well and with integrity.  They do their jobs for a salary that doesn't even begin to match the sacrifice that they and their families make. If you talk to police officers, most of them will say they aren't in law enforcement because they're just looking for employment, they could do any number of jobs and make more money and not risk their lives in the process. They're in law enforcement because they want to keep their communities safe, they want to help people.

And even though they are thousands of miles from my family and me, I owe them and their loved ones more than just my thoughts, I owe them a debt of gratitude because our safety can't be compartmentalized.

This weekend many of you will go to the movies with your families and friends. When deciding which theater to go to, I hope you'll stay away from Cinemark and any of the theaters it owns (cinemark.com). 

The Cinemark theater in Aurora, Colorado was the site of one of the worst mass shootings in our history, 12 people were killed and 70 were injured. 

In the aftermath of the shooting, some of the victims chose to sue Cinemark for what they deemed to be various security loopholes in the theater. In May, a jury decided that Cinemark was not liable for damages.  I'm not going to get into whether or not their lawsuits had merit -- it's what Cinemark elected to do after they won that has me angry. 

Under Colorado law -- and this is the case in many states -- if a person files suit and loses, they are often on the hook for the attorney's fees of the opposing side. Cinemark, a company with a net operating income of over $200 million a year has elected to exercise their right to recover and is demanding $700,000 from two dozen survivors and some of the parents who lost their kids in the shooting. 

I'm a pro-business Democrat (I own over a dozen small businesses myself) but capitalism without empathy is not the American way -- we are better than this. Cinemark may have the right to recover attorney fees but why would they want to re-victimize over two dozen people who have faced the horror of gun violence. Some of the injured victims in this case, have had to have multiple surgeries...the parents, in this case, have lost their children. 

Cinemark should have taken its victory and moved on -- to demand $700,000 from people who can least afford it is unconscionable. 

I have attached the audio from a radio interview today where I discussed the boycott.

Within days, a group of local attorneys responded by forming the Legal Community Against Violence, now known as the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  Unwilling to stand by, they mobilized the Bay Area legal community to step up and help stop the violence.  23 years later, California has lead the way with commonsense gun reforms that have resulted in a dramatic decrease in gun deaths—a 56% drop over two decades, statewide.

Last fall, the Law Center and I came together to co-author the Safety for All Act, which will be on the CA November ballot.

10128918116_10154341623613117,"Twelve years ago, when I ordered the San Francisco city clerk to give same-sex couples marriage licenses, I was filled with a sense of hope – a hope that together we could produce change and create a sense of acceptance and openness for every American, no matter what his or her sexual orientation might be. I watched as couples across the nation were given the opportunity to express their love for one another and the happiness it brought to communities across our state and country.

Then yesterday morning came. I woke to see 49 people of the LGBT community had been shot and killed by a man filled with hatred, threatened by the openness and diversity we have worked so hard to embed in our culture and communities.

I am heartbroken. I am outraged. 

It makes me sick to even begin discussing politics in the immediate aftermath of such a massacre – but to tell you the truth, I’ve heard too many on the right labeling what happened at Pulse an act of Islamic terrorism and forgetting to mention the issues of homophobia, transphobia and gun rights that lie at the center of this massacre and run rampant through our national discourse.

Yesterday as President Obama addressed our nation for the 15th time on gun violence, he said, ""This massacre is a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

I’ve made my decision. I’m taking action to keep guns and ammo out of the hands of violent, dangerous, hateful people. That’s what our Safety for All initiative is all about and why it’s so important that we all get behind it. Lives depend on it.

 It’s time to make decisions, take action and save lives. America has too many guns and too much bigotry. The result is the massacre in Orlando. I lament for the families, loved ones and all those touched by this terrible crime. But, more importantly, I’m committed to taking action.

10128918116_10154327914738117,"Like most of you, I have been horrified by the rape incident at Stanford which was perpetrated by Brock Allen Turner.  The victim in this case has decided to release the statement she read in court. Even though she has chosen to remain anonymous -- she has shown an incredible amount of courage by openly sharing her story. 

I have posted her statement (unedited) below. I hope you will take the time to read it. 

Your Honor, if it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.

You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today.

On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself “big mama”, because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.

The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.

Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.
I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said “Rape Victim” and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a Nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.

After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.

On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs and I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.

My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweatsuit, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours in silence my younger sister held me.

My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, “I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?” I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find [my sister]. Again, he asked me, “What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?” I said yes, and hung up to cry.
I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real.

I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For over a week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.
One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me, this can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.

It’s like if you were to read an article where a car was hit, and found dented, in a ditch. But maybe the car enjoyed being hit. Maybe the other car didn’t mean to hit it, just bump it up a little bit. Cars get in accidents all the time, people aren’t always paying attention, can we really say who’s at fault.

And then, at the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extracurriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened.

The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up.

The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. 

A back rub.

Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us even speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.

I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.
I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.

When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.

Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. 

The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering questions like:

How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’ d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, well, we’ll let Brock fill it in.

I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who had me half naked before even bothering to ask for my name. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now.
And then it came time for him to testify and I learned what it meant to be revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.

So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.

He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.

According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan.
Next in the story, two Swedes on bicycles approached you and you ran. When they tackled you why didn’t say, “Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you.” I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen.

Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet. That was never the point. I was too drunk to speak English, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, “At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.” Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I became unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?

You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Pick the pine needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the two guys had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year.

On top of all this, he claimed that I orgasmed after one minute of digital penetration. The nurse said there had been abrasions, lacerations, and dirt in my genitalia. Was that before or after I came?

To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by Swedes for reasons unknown to you is appalling, is demented, is selfish, is damaging. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity of validity of this suffering.

My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, hair messed up, limbs bent, and dress hiked up. And even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, significant trauma to her genitalia, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to your attorney attempt to paint a picture of me, the face of girls gone wild, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.

He has done irreversible damage to me and my family during the trial and we have sat silently, listening to him shape the evening. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.
You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty ­six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. 

Then I read your statement.

If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. This is not a story of another drunk college hook­up with poor decision making. Assault is not an accident. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused. I will now read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them.

You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she.

Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.
You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.
I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want to be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not.

You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.

Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and my own sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.

You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.

Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold.
You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to “speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.”
Campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to people about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.

Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus Sexual Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide. Rest assured, if you fail to fix the topic of your talk, I will follow you to every school you go to and give a follow up presentation.

Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.

A life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.
See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was “unconscious intoxicated woman”, ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All­ American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, my life was put on hold for over a year, waiting to figure out if I was worth something.

My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you. The pain became so bad that I had to explain the private details to my boss to let her know why I was leaving. I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. I did not return to work full time as I knew I’d have to take weeks off in the future for the hearing and trial, that were constantly being rescheduled. My life was put on hold for over a year, my structure had collapsed.

I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning.

I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.
You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.

You cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.

When I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over again she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, “[Her sister] said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.” You tried to use my own sister against me? Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. 

You do not touch her.

You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.

Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. But right now, you do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You have been convicted of violating me, intentionally, forcibly, sexually, with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.
Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.

My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.

I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time­out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, an insult to me and all women. It gives the message that a stranger can be inside you without proper consent and he will receive less than what has been defined as the minimum sentence. Probation should be denied. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.
Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s report, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of “promiscuity”. By definition rape is not the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction.

The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.

As this is a first offence I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative.
The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. How fast Brock swims does not lessen the severity of what happened to me, and should not lessen the severity of his punishment. If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.

The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say.

What has he done to demonstrate that he deserves a break? He has only apologized for drinking and has yet to define what he did to me as sexual assault, he has revictimized me continually, relentlessly. He has been found guilty of three serious felonies and it is time for him to accept the consequences of his actions. He will not be quietly excused.

He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.
To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my grandma who snuck chocolate into the courtroom throughout this to give to me, my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.

Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.
And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. As the author Anne Lamott once wrote, “Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining.” Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you.",,status,,2016-06-08 19:11:54,2336,175,505,1705,132,18,0,432,49,Gavin

10128918116_10154325625033117,"In all the nastiness of this presidential campaign cycle, we must not lose sight of the historic nature of this race on two fronts. 

For the first time in our nation's history, a woman is now the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party. This is a profound moment for our daughters. The idea of a woman running for president isn't just a dream to strive for anymore, but a reality that they can experience and always remember. Secretary Clinton's victory is also a profound moment for our sons. Just like our daughters, they will now know what is possible. The impact this will have on institutional gender bias should not be understated. 

Second, a US Senator from Vermont built a movement -- against all odds -- that we should all be grateful for. Senator Sanders built this movement and became a formidable candidate largely based on issues that most candidates wouldn't take on. 

He has built an incredible campaign that brought in millions of young voters who would have otherwise not been engaged in our political process. He has proven -- without a doubt -- that you can build a viable presidential campaign with donors giving an average of $27 each (something I hope will become the norm.) 

Most important, he and his campaign have inspired millions of people to be passionate about public policy, passionate about holding their elected officials accountable, and encouraged them to be unquestioned in their commitment to speaking up -- trust me, I have seen the tweets and Facebook comments. 

In the cynical, distracted world we live in, that is a remarkable accomplishment.

My passion for reasonable gun control is not just born of the tragic mass shootings at schools and houses of worship, but also of the heartbreaking statistics like how African-Americans are twice as likely to die from gun violence as whites.

 But it is not enough to be frustrated.  We must break this destructive cycle through action - real, substantive action that makes a real, substantive impact on the status quo.

While many people see his candidacy as a joke, given his recent position in the GOP presidential polls, it is clear that his thoughts are gaining traction.

Instead of returning the contribution directly to him, I am doubling it and giving it to organizations that are doing important work to support and lift up immigrants who love our country and contribute to the California and American Dream. We should be supporting our immigrant communities, not tearing them down.  I hope you will join me in supporting the work these organizations are doing.

After all, our state is defined by its independent, outspoken spirit.  When Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly – without evasiveness or equivocation.

So today I’m announcing that I’m creating a committee to run for California Governor in 2018.  Because I truly and passionately believe in the future of this great state.

Today, Californians are blessed with the remarkable leadership of Governor Jerry Brown, who in the face of long odds has led our state to firm fiscal footing and brought us to the enviable position of dreaming – and achieving – big dreams again.

Even so, long-term challenges remain daunting – we must continue to grow our economy and create private-sector jobs, we must invest in public education and keep college affordable, we must address the widening inequalities that separate our communities and we must maintain California’s historic leadership in meeting the climate challenge.  

Over the next four years, my advocacy and efforts on these issues as your Lieutenant Governor will continue unabated.  And I will actively support Governor Brown and our Legislature in every way I can.

But the reality of running for Governor – even four years from now – in America’s largest, most diverse state demands that I start raising resources now if we’re going to lead a conversation worthy of the 38 million people who live, work, attend school and raise families in the Golden State.   

Creating this committee gives people a way to support our efforts – and I hope you can help spread the word.

I make this promise – this won’t be an ordinary campaign – but, then again, California has always been an extraordinary place.   

As ever, thank you for your friendship,

Today, the highest court in the land reaffirmed America's greatest ideal -- there is no such thing as second-class citizen.

Nine years ago, San Francisco played a small part in a movement that some dismissively called ""civil disobedience.""  Today, that civil disobedience has become civil rights.
By any historical measure, America's evolutionary embrace of marriage equality has occurred in only a short period of time.  And yet,  for those loving couples in California left waiting at the altar of liberty, it has taken far too long.

As we rightfully celebrate today, we must not lose sight of the larger goal and understand that the fight continues for all those who are unable to live openly with the full expression of love that we now enjoy in California.
Many people around the country and world came to our defense when Proposition 8 passed and lent their voices to our cause.

With this victory comes the responsibility to now move beyond our borders to help our brothers and sisters around the country to realize their full potential to live a life of love with whomever they chose.",,status,,2013-06-26 18:12:12,6023,399,540,6023,0,0,0,0,0,Gavin

Has the voting situation for Americans improved? That is undeniable, as the court states in the majority, “There is no doubt that these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act.” Why effectively cripple the law?
Better is not good enough. As the majority pointed out in its opinion, “any racial discrimination in voting is too much.”

We cannot wait for the next federal election to make a change, elections are happening constantly across this country and today’s court decision makes millions of voters vulnerable to discrimination. I call on Congress and the President to put this issue on the front burner and act accordingly.",,status,,2013-06-25 13:29:47,2108,155,330,2108,0,0,0,0,0,Gavin

10128918116_10151577500193117,"The President got what he asked for today in his State of the Union Address – a vote. In fact, he got several votes. A handful of shameful, cowardly votes against a safer country for our children.
 
In a State of the Union address that moved the country, President Obama intoned over and again, “They deserve a vote.” But today the United States Senate voted and let down the victims of gun violence, their families and the American people.
 
One by one, in a series of votes on the Senate floor, amendments to address gun violence in this country failed.  An amendment by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-San Francisco) that would have banned assault weapons as well as another by Senators Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) on background checks failed passage, along with a stream of others.
 
The most disturbing defeat is that of Toomey-Manchin, a watered down amendment that would have provided for expanded, but not universal, background checks. Senator after senator rose on the floor to oppose the measure spouting the talking points of the National Rifle Association. Talking points that are flat out lies. Even with the authors of the amendment on the floor asking and answering questions for other senators, the lies, half-truths and scare tactics of the NRA won the day by a vote of 54 to 46.
 
While I respect Republican Senator Toomey for appearing to work in a bipartisan manner with Senator Manchin, I have to question his commitment to real action when, within minutes of his co-authored amendment failing, his statement to the press included the line “the Senate has spoken on the subject, and it’s time to move on.” Was this a thoughtful attempt at real legislation or was this Senator Toomey’s attempt to check a box in his next election so he could claim to the people of Pennsylvania, “I tried.”
 
While Mr. Toomey moves on, I hope the President and Democratic leaders in Washington understand that the American people have not. It is not acceptable for politicians to claim they have tried and put this issue on the shelf again until another Virginia Tech, Aurora, Newtown, Tucson or Columbine occurs.
 
The Democratic leadership in Washington, DC must demand more than just a vote; they must demand real and meaningful action. If we cannot muster the 60 votes for a watered down Toomey-Manchin Amendment, we will never achieve meaningful reforms such as universal background checks, banning assault weapons or limiting the capacity of a gun magazine.
 
We are the majority party. The people of the United States voted to give Democrats control of the Senate and it is time that Senator Harry Reid and his leadership team start acting the part.
 
In a recent discussion with a senior member of the United States Senate, he waxed nostalgically about how back in the good old days all we needed was 50 votes plus one to get things passed. That democratic principal still applies, so maybe it’s time the leadership in the Senate had some guts and started playing hardball.
 
If we allow our ideas, rather than our ideology, to carry the day then the voters will have a clear and distinct choice in the voting booth. But to allow a small handful of cowardly Democrats and the likes of Ted Cruz stall what the people are demanding, tells Americans their votes don’t count as much as the NRA’s money.
 
When it comes to guns, the people of the United States no longer care about political party values. They care about getting results.
 
For their sake, and that of our party, I hope the President and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stay true to their word that today was not the end and the theatre of votes that took place on the Senate floor will not be the last act.
 
If this is the end of the debate until the next tragedy, hopefully the voters will speak at the ballot box and replace these cowards with U.S. Senators that will do the right thing to protect our children from gun violence and honor the many that have already lost their lives.
 
Because we all deserve more than just a vote…we deserve action.",,status,,2013-04-17 21:17:42,2705,298,669,2705,0,0,0,0,0,Gavin

10128918116_10151565817983117,"Is the bar on bipartisan achievement really this low?
 
While Washington, DC congratulates itself for today’s bipartisan Toomey-Manchin proposal on background checks, the rest of the country is still waiting for meaningful gun control and mental health reform.
 
Senators Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced what is supposed to be significant legislation on guns. What we received is yet another show-pony piece of legislation that falls well short of universal background checks and does nothing to address the underlying issues of mental health and gun violence in America.
 
As Senator Toomey stood in the press conference announcing the so-called bipartisan compromise, he acknowledged that the proposal was not gun control legislation. I couldn’t agree more.
 
The proposed bill will extend current law to non-federally licensed persons engaged in the business of selling guns and require purchases of their guns be subject to background checks. So the gun show loophole presumably gets closed, but the bill continues to protect non-federally licensed private sales and transfers without background checks.
 
The most troublesome part of this faux reform is that the proposal does nothing to address the 20 percent of private gun sales that the U.S. Department of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimates are part of trafficking or gun diversion criminal enterprises.
 
Because this proposal does nothing to require background checks on private sales, where plenty of illegal firearms already change hands, the Senators’ proposal will further drive those that should not own guns into the underground, private sales market.
 
Is this progress? I guess you can call it that in the same way you can call rolling forward five feet in rush hour traffic on Highway 101 progress too.
 
If politicians are serious about addressing the symptoms and the disease of gun violence in America this proposal can’t be the end of the line in Washington, DC.  The leadership in Congress needs to step up and bring everything forward for a vote, not just the paltry measure sponsored by Senators Toomey and Manchin.
 
Where is the assault weapons ban? Where is the limitation on high-capacity magazines? Where is the ban on trafficking and straw purchasing? And dammit, where is the real discussion about mental health reform?
 
The answer to all but the last question above is “nowhere to be found” because the biggest bully on Capitol Hill, the NRA, doesn’t want any of these measures to see the light of day.
 
The first clue that today’s proposal was weak came within minutes of the bill’s announcement when the NRA released a statement calling the measure “a positive development” because it rejected the universal background check plan that is being supported by President Obama and Mayor Michael Bloomberg and voters nationwide.
 
So congratulations Senators, today you gave us a proposal that the NRA isn’t opposing, but you’ve ignored what 90 percent of Americans say they want – universal background checks.
 
When will Washington realize that doing the bare minimum is not enough?

When the city of San Francisco started on this journey in 2004, we were very aware that marrying same-sex couples would lead to litigation. We were also cognizant that we could have moved forward with a legal battle without challenging state law. But discrimination and inequality is as much about people as it is the law, and in marrying Phyllis Lyon and the late Del Martin, a loving committed couple of 50 years, we put a human face to marriage inequality.

The human faces - mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, grandchildren - have turned the cultural and political tide of this country. The monumental shift in public opinion during the last decade is a tribute to the hard work of LGBT activists and allies who continue to battle at the ballot box for equal treatment under the law - state-by-state, vote-by-vote. LGBT communities across this nation have won over individuals of all religious and political persuasions by rationally advancing that there is no basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of the basic rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.

I salute Ted Olson, David Boies and the American Federation for Equal Rights as well as Dennis Herrera, Therese Stewart and the staff of San Francisco City Attorney's Office for their tireless passion and staunch commitment as the fight maneuvered through the legal system. Olson's pointed argument before the Justices of the Supreme Court was eloquent and persuasive, establishing a powerful narrative for equal treatment under law.

We are on the verge of the ultimate victory for same-sex couples. Now, as we patiently await the final verdict by the Supreme Court, I believe that a majority of justices will validate that those who yearn to live in loving, committed relationships can do so without the stain of discrimination.

Debemos sentirnos orgullosos de que, el cimiento de nuestra patria sea la premisa "" todos los hombres son iguales"". Más orgullosos aún, de que, a pesar de que los Padres de nuestra nación no dijeron específicamente, mujeres, afroamericanos, indios nativos u otro europeo sin tierras, a través de nuestra historia nos hemos esforzado por lograr ""una unión cada vez más perfecta"", luchando para hacer realidad esa noción básica de la existencia humana.

 Nos convertimos en una ""unión más perfecta"" cuando la esclavitud fue abolida e incorporamos a nuestra Constitución,  la Enmienda 14 y después la Enmienda 19, que otorga a todos los ciudadanos igualdad ante la Ley y a las mujeres, el derecho al voto.

 Más tarde, el Acta de Derechos Civiles, el Acta sobre Derecho al Sufragio y el movimiento femenil, dieron un significado real a la  frase ""todos los hombres"" frente a la noción más limitada de nuestros antepasados y otorgaron más legitimidad a nuestra democracia.

La decisión de la Suprema Corte sobre la Igualdad ante el Matrimonio, representa un paso más hacia adelante, en lo que debe ser nuestra lucha constante por expandir la libertad y ""la búsqueda de la felicidad"" para todos.

Debemos, no obstante, celebrar nuestros progresos con vigorosa vigilancia, ante las amenazas a nuestra libertad. Los atroces asesinatos de nueve inocentes personas de color, en la iglesia ""Mother Emanuel"" A.M.E., son un recordatorio del odio racial y de la intolerancia  persistentes en muchos individuos. Los comentarios obtusos sobre los inmigrantes mexicanos, hechos por un bufón narcisista, candidato presidencial, deben ser confrontados, sin importar  quienes sean el blanco de esa retórica de odio.

En este día glorioso, mientras nos regocijamos por la fundación de nuestra Patria, no nos permitamos ""dormir en nuestros laureles"". ¡Nuestra lucha por crear ""una unión más perfecta"" no ha terminado!

 Para aquellos que dirían, en respuesta, ""ama o abandona América"", replicaríamos,  en este día maravilloso: ""América, te amo y quiero que seas todo lo que nosotros aspiramos a ser""

 ¡Feliz cumpleaños América adorada!

We should be proud of our nation's founding on the premise that ""all men are created equal"". Prouder still, that although our nation's founding fathers did not mean women, blacks, Native Americans or other non-landowning Europeans. We have throughout our history strived to be "" a more perfect union"" struggling to realize that basic notion of human existence.

We became ""a more perfect union"" when we abolished slavery, passed the 14th Amendment and later the 19th Amendment to our Constitution  giving all our citizens equal protection under the law and women the right to vote.

Later the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Acts and the women's movement gave real meaning to our forefather's limited notion of ""all men"" and gave our democracy more legitimacy.

The Supreme Court decision on marriage equality is another step forward in what must be a never ending quest to expand liberty and ""the pursuit of happiness"" for all.

We must however celebrate our progress with vigorous vigilance in the face of threats to our freedoms. The heinous murder of nine innocent black congregants  at  ""Mother Emanuel "" A.M.E. Church is a reminder of the residual racial hate and intolerance that still exists in too many.  The bigoted comments about Mexican immigrants by a narcissistic and buffoon-like presidential candidate, must be challenged regardless of who is the target of such hate speech.

So on this glorious day as we rejoice in our nation's founding let us not rest on our laurels, our struggle to create a ""more perfect union"" is still not done! 

To those who would say in response, "" America love it or leave it"" we say on this wonderful day, America I love you and want you to be all that we have held ourselves to be!

Happy Birthday my  beloved America!

“Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court to uphold the basic provisions of the Affordable Care Act is a historic step forward for our country. Healthcare for each and every individual is not a privilege; it’s a right. This morning’s decision is a victory for all Americans, and I could not be prouder.

By upholding the Affordable Care Act the Supreme Court ensured 3.1 million young people – including 435,000 young Californians – will maintain their coverage. The Court’s ruling protects Americans with preexisting conditions and provides them with access to the safe and secure healthcare options that were once out of reach. By ruling that those people who can afford to buy insurance have an obligation to do so, the Court has reaffirmed the bedrock principle of personal responsibility. And most importantly, the Court’s ruling moves our nation one step closer to the ultimate goal of providing healthcare for all. More than 30 million Americans will gain affordable health care with the enactment of this bill. This is a momentous achievement that should be rightly celebrated.

Despite today’s victory, our work is not done. America still spends more than any other nation for health insurance. The Affordable Care Act provides important protections to curb the skyrocketing cost of healthcare and lessen the impact on the nation’s budget. In fact, according to official estimates, the law will lower the federal deficit by $143 billion by 2019. It is now incumbent on our nation’s leaders to ensure the successful implementation of this bill. We must halt the opponents of progress who seek to “repeal and replace” this important step towards universal coverage.

I applaud the Supreme Court’s leadership and decision to put the American people ahead of partisan politics. Their ruling to uphold the Affordable Care Act reaffirms our country’s commitment to the health and financial security of our people.”",,status,,2012-06-28 18:07:44,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Antonio
387765724593305_403953339641210,"My statement regarding Congress reaching an agreement on a transportation bill that includes America Fast Forward: 

""America Fast Forward is a path-breaking program that will dramatically accelerate transportation projects across the country.

I applaud Congress for including America Fast Forward in the agreement to reauthorize the nation’s surface transportation programs. I specifically want to thank Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Boxer, Ranking Member Inhofe, Chairman Mica, and Ranking Member Rahall for their far-sighted leadership in crafting the agreement and moving forward with much-needed investments in our country's roads, bridges and rail lines.

The Surface Transportation Bill will preserve 2 million jobs. With the inclusion of America Fast Forward, it will put close to an additional million Americans to work.

Working in partnership with the US Conference of Mayors, we assembled a broad, bipartisan coalition, including nearly 200 mayors and both the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce, to bring America Fast Forward to fruition.

America Fast Forward expands an existing program – the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program – to give cities access to low-interest financing with flexible terms for their projects.

With America Fast Forward in place, cities across America will be able to speed up the construction of locally funded road and rail projects and get our economy moving again.

All of our proposals were included in the bill and we greatly appreciate Congress' support for these common-sense ideas.

Here in Los Angeles, this agreement on the Surface Transportation reauthorization and America Fast Forward will mean more jobs for Angelenos and will make it possible for us to accelerate our vision of a 21st century transportation network.""",,status,,2012-06-28 18:04:59,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,Antonio

The Supreme Court rightly upheld the bedrock constitutional principle that the federal government alone has the power to regulate immigration. It is clear that the Obama Administration and the Department of Justice were right to challenge this law.
 
But today’s ruling must be seen as only a partial victory. The Supreme Court’s decision does allow Arizona to implement the law’s most problematic and potentially most harmful section: the ‘papers please’ provision.
 
By requiring police officers to demand documents of anyone they suspect of being in the country without authorization, Arizona risks creating a culture of fear and suspicion. Implementation of the law will undermine the trust between the police and the public, driving a wedge between police officers and the community they serve. The papers please provision opens the door for racial profiling, and I believe it will be impossible to implement this law without discrimination. This will just invite further litigation.
 
In today’s decision, the Supreme Court rightly drew attention to the lasting contributions that immigrants have made to this country. We need a sensible and humane national immigration policy. We do not need a confusing patchwork of 50 state laws. It is time for Congress to act. It is time to pass the DREAM ACT and it is time to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

“By ending the deportation of certain young immigrants and making them eligible to work in this country, President Obama has taken a bold step in the direction of a more humane and more sensible immigration policy. His action today upholds some of America’s most cherished values: our belief in opportunity and fairness and our tradition of openness and inclusion. Crucially with his decision, the President has also protected young immigrants, many of whom have been here since they were infants and have spent their whole lives in this country. Instead of fearing deportation, instead of facing the prospect of being separated from their loved ones, hundreds of thousands of young people can now do what generations of their predecessors have done. They can contribute their energy and enthusiasm and their dreams and determination to their new home and help drive the future prosperity and growth of the United States.

After an extended and frustrating impasse in our national immigration debate, President Obama has led the way and pointed us in the right direction.
