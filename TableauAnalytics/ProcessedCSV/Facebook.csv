What have you personally done to help feed the hungry and homeless? Don't give them money; which merely helps them stay homeless and addicted. Support services (with time and money) that help these folks get on a long term, sustainable path. Find a local shelter and programs that help people get clean, sober, fed, clothed and on a path to mental health.  Try 10 acre ranch; they try to help all, regardless of insurance status or income. Or support single payer so EVERYONE is covered and can get mental health and addiction services. Again it's Republicans that care not about these folks.

The Western notion of masculinity goes back a long way. It doesn't allow for women, and it's also racistâ??it doesn't allow for other cultures. It's just as racist and misogynistic as it ever was. The image of the cowboy is one of the dominant images in American culture.

For a woman to be strong and have the ability to think on her own becomes offensive to ""feminists"" because she may not agree with abortion or she may want to have a husband or be treated like a lady.

I will not say there is none of that in the so called conservative movement as well but I call that out when I see it too. I am for a government that allows us our freedoms and who's only true purpose is to maintain safety of it citizens and our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

You keep defending  a man who holds the highest office in this Nation.  The very office he should have the decency to treat with respect by the way he talks & acts in public and how he portrayed himself to Americans & the World.  At the very least he could at least TRY to 'appear to be a sane person"" vs tweeting insanities & insults even to and about the people he himself put in various official positions.  You watch him DAILY lashing out & continuing to act like a spoiled 2 year old throwing temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way or if someone doesn't do as he says or disagrees with him in the slightest way or God forbid points out a different point of view to be considered, he doesn't even listen to his own advisories he hand picked!You continue to just keep listening to, regurgitating his words, believing him like it is normal & acceptable behavior.  You would NEVER go along so blindly if any other person in your life acted as he does, you would NOT be standing by & defending their actions & such behavior.  So my question to Trump followers is this, if he continues to throw his own selectioned people under the bus, whom he knows personally & chose, what makes you think & believe he won't do the same to you?

As someone with 4 great sisters a wonderful mom and a dad to a one in a million daughter I fully support their intelligence and strength and independence but I don't think men have to in any way become weaker to make them feel strong or validate it for them. They are capable of achieving what they want to and standing in their own feet when they need to and allow the men in their lives to be strong and ""manly"" as well. Would you not rather have the support of a strong self assured man than that of a whimpering dog who himself buckles to the societal pressures that think you should feel guilty because your a man?
I will get a ladies door or offer a compliment when the occasion allows but it has nothing more to do with objectification of women than flying to the moon it is called kindness and respect. The whole idea behind this article is an effort to make genuine men feel like it is wrong to just be a guy. Not even to be equals but less than because you are too male... I don't excuse crass or rude behavior to women and have never in my life raised a hand to any woman but it isn't strength to do those things. Men ""real"" men do not need to soften to make others strong they help to make others strong to bring them up.

At the very least he could at least TRY to 'appear to be a sane person"" vs tweeting insanities & insults even to and about the people he himself put in various official positions.

They are capable of achieving what they want to and standing in their own feet when they need to and allow the men in their lives to be strong and ""manly"" as well. Would you not rather have the support of a strong self assured man than that of a whimpering dog who himself buckles to the societal pressures that think you should feel guilty because your a man?
I will get a ladies door or offer a compliment when the occasion allows but it has nothing more to do with objectification of women than flying to the moon it is called kindness and respect. The whole idea behind this article is an effort to make genuine men feel like it is wrong to just be a guy. Not even to be equals but less than because you are too male... I don't excuse crass or rude behavior to women and have never in my life raised a hand to any woman but it isn't strength to do those things.
